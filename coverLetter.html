        <p>When I first began attending Old Colony RVTHS - a vocational high school that offers 13 different technical programs, one of which you choose to take for all four years at Old Colony - I had no idea what path I wanted to pursue. Old Colony has students learn their chosen trade half of the time that they are in school, while the other half is divided between academic classes. With this in mind, the decision of what field I wanted to be instructed in was not one to be taken lightly. All of the various vocational courses had their own merits, and I knew equally little about any of them. What I did know was that whatever I picked I wanted it to be a skill that offered me career opportunities and one that I could see myself pursuing later in life. Thankfully, students are offered a couple of months of “exploratory” during which you can experience multiple different shops to get a feel for which one to select.</p>
	     <p>Going into my exploratory week for computer science, I had little idea of what it was that computer scientists did. Yes, I knew that they wrote code, but I had yet to realize the full scope of the industry, with its vast array of jobs, skills, and expertise with which to benefit society. Once I listened to my instructors’ experiences and perspectives, I began to understand that when you boil it down, computer science is really about solving problems. Almost any problem one could think of can be solved by programming, be it how to create the navigation system in a car or develop complex medical systems within hospitals. It intrigued me how computer science was a trade that had a hand in the industry of all the other shops, and how I could use programming knowledge in almost any field in the real world. This realization of the potential problem-solving tools that I would have at my disposal and the freedom to get a job in any real-world industry once I graduated made computer science an easy choice once it came time to decide. </p>
	     <p>Throughout my freshman, sophomore, and junior years of learning computer science, I completed many lengthy and complex projects that helped to apply and improve my knowledge of the field. In my freshman year, I made a complex calendar program in Python and learned the basic principles of programming. In my sophomore year, I made a teacher-student communication tool using a database in MIT’s Appinventor, completed several multi-paged websites, and learned how to make animations in javascript, which I used in an online hangman game. In my junior year, I created a 2D space shooter in Unity and created a multi-classed crossword puzzle program that utilized file handling in Java. I also competed in the SkillsUSA web design competition twice, an annual contest for high school trade students around the country. The first time I competed, I earned a gold medal at the local competition and a bronze medal at the district competition as a sophomore. The second time I competed, I earned a gold medal at the local competition, a gold medal at the district competition, and a bronze medal at the state-level competition. Each of these times, I was competing against all web design students, including seniors. </p>
	     <p>Before I came to Old Colony, I was not sure what I wanted to do when the time came to go to college and then enter the workforce. After having been a student there for three years, I am incredibly thankful to have found my calling, and that is a great feeling to have.</p>
