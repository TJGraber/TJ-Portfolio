        <p class = "reflectionParagraph">As a student during a pandemic, my first year of high school was rather unique when compared to those who had come before me. On top of that, it was also my first time attending a vocational school and I did so with a brand new set of classmates. Thinking back to middle school, it seems almost impossible that I would have ended up at Old Colony. I hadn’t even realized that a vocational school was an option, and even once I had, I wasn’t considering it. By 8th grade, however, I decided that I wanted to do something different. I didn’t want my high school experience to be middle school part two. When I took the time to consider it, I realized that learning a trade could be extremely beneficial to me. Finally, when the time came, I decided to apply to Old Colony. I didn’t know what I wanted to do, but I knew that it was the place I wanted to go.</p>
        
        <p class = "reflectionParagraph">Thankfully for me, my sister had started going to Old Colony the year before me, so she filled me in on most aspects of the school before I even arrived. With that in mind, there were things that I had made assumptions about which turned out to be fairly inaccurate. For example, before I had started going to OC, I had assumed that it was a really big school, being that it had students from a wide assortment of different towns and there was a decent level of competition to get in. However, the population of students was not nearly as large as I thought it was. I also thought that I wouldn’t be able to find a place where I fit in or a shop that I enjoy. However, as it turned out, I fit right into computer science and I can’t see myself being anywhere else. Both of these things greatly added to the sense of community at the school.</p>
        
        <p class = "reflectionParagraph">On the academic side of things, I found myself enjoying the content more than normal. I liked my teachers who knew what they were talking about and had great teaching methods. I enjoyed the subjects that were covered in algebra and biology, and learning about American history has been fascinating. My attitude towards school shifted from my earlier years, as I started to have an appreciation for what I was learning. I knew that a lot of what I was experiencing in and outside of the classroom would benefit me greatly later in life. Because of all of this, and despite all of the uncertain circumstances surrounding the year, I look back at my freshman year with a very positive outlook.</p>
        
        <p class = "reflectionParagraph">My sophomore year at OC saw a return to normalcy as the pandemic began to die down. The year started with the mask mandate still in full effect, however, unlike the previous year, we were able to avoid going remote at all. Eventually, after February vacation, the mandate was lifted and Old Colony students were no longer required to wear masks to school. This was something that I was personally a bit conflicted about because while losing the masks would be a major quality of life improvement, it would also mean that I would be less safe from sickness. Thankfully, Covid was no longer running rampant, so it ended up working out well. The loss of the masks was strange, but it allowed me to interact with my peers and teachers way better.</p>
        
        <p class = "reflectionParagraph">In academics that year, I expanded my knowledge on top of the foundation that I already had. I finished my learning of US history that I had started freshman year, concluding with the Civil Rights movement. In English, I prepared for MCAS which I took successfully. For a science class, I took engineering and technology. While I had already taken an engineering class in middle school, this class was a good expansion of my skills and I did some cool projects. This year, I took two math classes, my normal class, geometry, and a dual enrollment college algebra II course which I took through BCC. I took this class because passing it allowed me to jump up a class and take precalculus the next year. The class was very difficult, and it wasn’t easy to have the extra work on top of the normal classes that I was already taking, but I was able to complete it with a decent grade.</p>
        
        <p class = "reflectionParagraph">As a sophomore, I got to experience my first full year of Shop. It seems crazy just how much I was able to get done. I learned Blockly through App Inventor and used it to complete my Create Task before going on to take the computer science principles AP exam. I expanded my knowledge of HTML and CSS skills and went on to learn JavaScript through CodeHS which I incorporated into websites. I completed the Cisco IoT course by passing the final exam and I gained a solid understanding of IoT concepts and practices.</p>
        
        <p class = "reflectionParagraph">One of the most vital years of high school is your junior year as you become an upperclassman and have some of the toughest classes that you will take. You have already finished with MCAS so now the focus is put on the SATS and graduating the next year. I was quite happy with how the year went and felt ready to be a senior. The courses that I took that year included AP Java, computer science related, precalculus, world history, English, and chemistry.</p>
        
        <p class = "reflectionParagraph">That year I took my second of two AP computer science courses which I again passed and will be alloted college credits for completion. I thoroughly enjoyed learning the Java programming language for Shop and know that I am going to use it going forward whenever I have the choice. I feel confident in my Java skills whether it be creating multi-class programs or using text files within code. Some larger projects that I worked on in Shop in Java include a crossword puzzle program, a battleship program, an Oregon Trail game, and a Minesweeper game, with Minesweeper and the Oregon Trail being independent projects. All of these projects involved putting together the programming knowledge that I picked up over the previous three years to create functional and complex applications. I also continued with web development, creating increasingly more cohesive and better-looking websites. I did so well in web design this year that I made it to the Massachusetts SkillsUSA web design competition where I placed 3rd in the state with my teammate Ben. Going to Skills was a memorable experience and was certainly a highlight of my school year.</p>
        
        <p class = "reflectionParagraph">In my related class, I got my first taste of creating games in a game engine which was very interesting but difficult at times to wrap my head around. We worked on a few different 2D games within Unity and Visual Studio including Brick Breaker, a space shooter, a platformer, and a top-down JRPG. While creating games does involve coding, it is also very visual and involves connecting many different elements to create a working product.</p>
        
        <p class = "reflectionParagraph">My academic classes that year were well within my abilities to complete without too much difficulty. The two classes that I learned the most from were world history and precalculus as they were both courses that I had not taken before with world history covering topics that I did not know much about and precalculus diving into brand new math material. I was satisfied with all of my courses and felt confident that the next year would go just as smoothly.</p>
        
        <p class = "reflectionParagraph">During my senior year, the grind continued as I worked through my final year of primary education. I got accepted into and enrolled at UMass Dartmouth and began applying for scholarships. I continued with my computer science shop and related courses as well as AP calculus, AP literature, US government, and physics. I also had my third and final season of cross country and participated in my second year of National Honor Society.</p>
        
        <p class = "reflectionParagraph">In academics, the difficulty level ramped up steeply from previous years as I started taking two of the harder classes offered by College Board - calculus and literature. These classes significantly boosted my workload but if you can do well in them you can be significantly rewarded. As of writing this, I have not yet taken the AP exam for calculus or literature but I am hopeful that I will be able to pass both of them and avoid having to take those classes again in college. Physics and government did not deviate much from the standard coursework that I have gotten used to.</p>
        
        <p class = "reflectionParagraph">In my shop, I continued working with JavaFX and Scene Builder to create increasingly complex programs and applications. Some of the larger projects that we worked on included a banking application, a pharmacy application, and a movie ticketing application. All of these projects challenged my design, UI, and logic skills to create applications that not only function but are also user-friendly. I also continued with web design, making my portfolio with HTML and CSS. Computer science took on external web projects from the community including a website for the PTO’s Fall Festival, a website for the Rochester Affordable Housing Authority, and the Plumb Library. In my related, I continued working with Unity to develop games including a 3D survival game and Scrabble. </p>
        
        <p class = "reflectionParagraph">In my third and final season of cross country, I was made team captain and took on a role of leadership for my younger teammates. I also continued to improve upon my running skills and set a personal best time at the conference meet, having shaved well over seven minutes from the time that I started with at the beginning of my sophomore year.</p>
        
        <p class = "reflectionParagraph">With my high school years behind me, I’ll be going on to the next part of my life and learning experience at college. I’m confident that I’ll do well at that and will be able to have a great career in computer science.</p>
